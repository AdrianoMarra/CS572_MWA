1) setImmediate(), in comparison to setTimeout(), will always execute first, if inside an I/O cycle.
If on main module, then, it would be non-deterministic and would be based on performance of the processes,
therefore you may want to use setImmediate() when you want higher priority than setTimeout() in the event loop.

2) process.nextTick() is processed in the nextTick queue, therefore its processes has the highest priority 
among all the asynchronous modules, while setImmediate() has its callback scheduled to run inside the Check phase
,therefore it has less priority than process.nextTick().

3) Some of the native modules of Node.js are: v8, buffer, console, http, dns, events, stream, url, util, vm.
